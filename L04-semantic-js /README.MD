# Lecture 03 – CSS Basics

## What I implemented this lecture
- Created and linked an external CSS file (css/style.css) to my portfolio page.
- Applied basic typography rules for readability (font family, line height, heading sizes).
- Styled spacing, header/footer, navigation, and responsive images using CSS basics.

## CSS selectors I used (at least 5)
- Element selector: body, h1, h2, img
- Group selector: header, footer
- Descendant selector: nav a
- Class selector: .media
- ID selector: #works
- Pseudo-class: nav a:hover

## One thing I struggled with
- A key challenge encountered during the project was managing version control with Git and GitHub. Initial push attempts failed due to differences between the local and remote repositories. Through this, I learned how to resolve non-fast-forward errors by rebasing and properly synchronizing branches.

## One improvement I want to do next
- Improve the layout consistency by refining spacing and adding a clearer visual separation between sections.
