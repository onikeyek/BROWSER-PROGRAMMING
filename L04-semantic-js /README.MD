# Lecture 03 – CSS Basics

## What I implemented this lecture
- Theme Toggle
A button that switches the page between light and dark mode by toggling a CSS class on the <body>.

- Click Counter
A button that increases a counter each time it is clicked and logs the updated count to the browser console.

## How to Test

- Click the “Toggle theme” button to switch between light and dark mode.

- Click the “Click me” button to increase the counter and check the updated value in the browser console.
